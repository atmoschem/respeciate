respeciate gives you access to the [US/EPA Speciate v5.1](https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-modeling/speciate) profiles


The installation is:


```{r eval = F}
remotes::install_github("atmoschem/respeciate")
```

Sergio, 

I was think about using respeciate on a project and was having a play. As part of that, I: 

* moved your sysdata.rda to the package data folder 
* reset lazy.data to TRUE  
* added an object class 
* added sp_find_profile (find_code but making object class)
* added sp_profile (spec but making object class)
* added crude print and plot methods for object classes 
* updated date and version

The new code is in R/speciate.0.2.r

## example

Find profiles based on search criteria

```{r }
library(respeciate)
x <- sp_find_profile("Ethanol")
x
```


## speciate

```{r }
p <- sp_profile("8833")
```

## plot

Plotting a profile

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=5, fig.align="center", dpi=400}
#profiles have a default plot option
plot(p)
```

... or multiple profiles using barplot syntax

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=5, fig.align="center", dpi=400}
#using base barplot 
p2 <- sp_profile(c(8833, 8850))
plot(p2, beside=TRUE)
```

> NOTE: The respeciate objects are just data.frames at heart. So, please feel free to use any preferred plotting methods: ggplot2, lattice, etc...
