[![R build
    status](https://github.com/atmoschem/respeciate/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/atmoschem/respeciate/actions)

respeciate gives you access to air pollutant emissions profiles in the [US/EPA Speciate v5.2](https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-modeling/speciate) and 
[EU/JRC SPECIEUROPE v2.0](https://source-apportionment.jrc.ec.europa.eu/) archives via R.


The installation is:


```{r install, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("atmoschem/respeciate")
```

The currently packaged SPECIATE and SPECIEUROPE archives are:

```{r load}
library(respeciate)
# packaged archives
rsp_info()
```

## Example

Searching the respeciate (SPECIATE + SPECIEUROPE) for a profile, e.g. using a keyword: 

```{r find01}
rsp_find_profile("cement")
```

Limiting the search to just SPECIEUROPE: 

```{r find02}
rsp_find_profile("cement", source="eu")
```

Getting the first profile in SPECIEUROPE:

```{r get, fig.dpi=900, fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
prf <- rsp(1, source="eu")
prf
plot(prf)
```

Comparing that profile with pm profiles in (US EPA) SPECIATE:

```{r output.options, fig.dpi=900, fig.height=7.5, fig.width=15}
rsp_match_profile(prf, rsp_us_pm(), 
                  output = "plot,summary",
                  layout=c(5,2))
```

Notes: 

* The nearest match to the SPECIEUROPE EU:1 profile Cement from the US EPA SPECIATE PM subset is SPECIATE US:4377 Cement Kiln. 
* In addition, 5/9 of the other nearest matches are cement-related sources.  
* The nearest metrics, pd (Pearson's Distance), srd (Spearman Ranked Distance) and sid (Standardized Identity Distance), all tend to zero for better matches. See ?rsp_match_profile in the packaged resepciate documentation for details and references.
